## Overview

Welcome to the *maxvogt* collection repository, a 2024 research project by [Moritz Twente](https://mtwente.github.io/maxvogt-analysis/docs/about.html#people) (University of Basel) and [Luisa Omonsky](https://mtwente.github.io/maxvogt-analysis/docs/about.html#people) (Vienna University of Technology). The authors analyse buildings and other built structures designed by SBB architect Max Vogt from an urban design perspective, taking into account the buildings‚Äô placements in the built environment. In addition to this spatio-morphological analysis, another result of the project is an extensive survey of more than a hundred built structures that were designed by and/or under the supervision of Max Vogt during his time at SBB‚Äôs Zurich construction division. Combining different catalogues of works and linking additional sources to them, the authors present a novel online database built SBB heritage.

This project repository is the open-source code of the digital platform for research data output of the maxvogt project. It is a static website built with [CollectionBuilder-CSV](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Data created for this project by the authors is mainly hosted at [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Max_Vogt), with additional geodata and python scripts available on [GitHub](https://mtwente.github.io/maxvogt-analysis/). 

## Key Features

- **Fast Static Website**: Built with CollectionBuilder-CSV using open source static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a modern static web stack.
- **Explorative Access to Metadata**: Interactive features for exploring collection metadata such as maps, a timeline, filtering and comprehensive annotation.
- **Integration of External Resources**: Collection items include photographic records and maps produced by Moritz Twente and Luisa Omonsky. Additionally, records from the archives of [SBB Historic](https://www.sbbhistoric.ch/sammlungen-archive), from Wikimedia Commons and other available sources are integrated where feasible. Bibliographic information is available for all objects via linking to a [Zotero group library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5400359/sbb-max-vogt/library).
- **Accessibility-Focused Design**: Ensuring inclusivity for all users by complying with WCAG standards and observing neurodiversity design guidelines. <!-- More at our [accessibility statement](https://stadtgeschichtebasel.ch/barrierefreiheitserklaerung/). -->

### CollectionBuilder

The technical basis for this research data platform is provided by [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/), an open source framework for creating metadata-driven digital collections. CollectionBuilder is a project maintained by the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Initiatives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/) and the [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu) (CDIL) following the [Lib-Static](https://lib-static.github.io/) methodology.

The basic theme is created using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), tweaked by the authors using the [SBB colour palette](https://digital.sbb.ch/en/foundation/colors/base-colors/).
Metadata visualizations are built using open source libraries such as [DataTables](https://datatables.net/), [Spotlight gallery](https://github.com/nextapps-de/spotlight), [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes), [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/) and [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/).
Object metadata is exposed using [Schema.org](http://schema.org) and [Open Graph protocol](http://ogp.me/) standards.

## Data Model

Metadata for items featured in this project is provided according to a data model developed by the authors.

The following chart illustrates the data model with metadata fields for a sample metadata object `bu001` that has one child media object `bu001001`. If a metadata object has more than one child media object, the children `id`s are numbered consecutively: `bu001001`, `bu001002` etc.

    class structure {
        id (bu001)
