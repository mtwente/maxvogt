# About this Collection

This collection of media files (photos, maps, videos, written documents) and geodata was compiled as part of a research project on spatial/urban design features of railway-related built structures designed by the Swiss architect Max Vogt. **This collection is a work in progress and continuously being updated and expanded.**

Research Data Output is already available at [mtwente.github.io/maxvogt-analysis](https://mtwente.github.io/maxvogt-analysis/) resp. in the corresponding GitHub Repository.

For more information on the project, see [Project Information](https://mtwente.github.io/maxvogt-analysis/docs/about.html) and the [abstract](https://mtwente.github.io/maxvogt-analysis/docs/abstract.html) for a poster about this collection. The poster itself is presented at *Spatial Humanities 2024* at Otto-Friedrich-Universit√§t Bamberg and is [available on Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13837394).
